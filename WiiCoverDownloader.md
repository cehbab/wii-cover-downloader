**INFO**
  * All covers will downloaded from gametdb.com

**REQUIREMENTS**
  * PC with .NET 2.0 installed
  * Your devices with games and loader connected to your PC

**HOW TO USE**
  * Start the program
  * Select the device where there are the Loader (are supported USB Loader GX, Wiiflow and Configurable USB Loader).
  * The application automatically check which Loader are present in the selected device
  * Now select the device where are stored your games.
  * Then start the Download and wait. (LOL)
  * The application will download the images and then put in the correct folder for each Loader detected.

**CUSTOMIZATION**
  * If you want to change the language, go to "Language preferences" and change it.
  * In case you have already modified/customized paths for covers in Loader settings, change them also in this application: "Loader Path Preferences".
  * You can see the used paths for games (Wii games, Gamecube and Emulated Nand) in the "Device Path Preferences". If necessary change them according to your needs.

**HOW THE APPLICATION SEARCH GAMES IN DEVICE**
  * For Wii games, simply search .wbfs files. They have the ID directly in the name (es: SC7I52.wbfs = Call of Duty: Black Ops). If you haven't the ID as name of wbfs files, application can't download images. If you are using a WBFS partition.. no problem: I'll read it with wbfs\_file.exe .
  * For Game Cube Games, I supposed that them are in DIOS MIOS 'format' (es: games\GLMP01\game.iso = Luigi's Mansion). If you haven't games in the folder with ID, application can't download images.
  * For emulated NAND channel, I simply read folder name, for take ID of channels.
